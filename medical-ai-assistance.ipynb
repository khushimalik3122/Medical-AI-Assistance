Answer the medical question below using your advanced knowledge.\\n\\n### Query:\\nA 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or\\n              sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. Based on these findings,\\n              what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Answer:\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what cystometry would show for this 61-year-old woman. Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss, especially when she coughs or sneezes. But she doesn't leak at night. That makes me think about possible causes. Involuntary leakage during those activities usually points towards urinary incontinence, likely stress incontinence. But since it's not happening at night, it's probably not the result of overactive bladder or nocturia.\\n\\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. I'm not too familiar with the Q-tip test, but I think it's used to assess urethral function. Maybe it measures the closure pressure of the urethral sphincter? If the Q-tip test shows normal or good function, that might mean the sphincter is working okay, so the issue isn't with the sphincter itself.\\n\\nNow, considering her symptoms, if the sphincter is working fine, maybe the problem is higher up. The detrusor muscle is the main muscle for bladder emptying. If there's an issue with the detrusor, it might not contract properly, leading to incomplete emptying and thus urinary retention. But she's having leakage, so maybe the detrusor is overactive, leading to urge urinary incontinence. Alternatively, maybe the detrusor is not contracting well, causing the bladder to hold more urine, leading to overflow.\\n\\nWait, but she doesn't leak at night. So maybe her bladder capacity is normal, and she doesn't have nocturnal polyuria. The detrusor contractions might be normal, but the issue is that she can't hold the urine during the day because of stress or something else.\\n\\nWait, but she's 61, and maybe she's experiencing some age-related changes. The detrusor might become less responsive over time, leading to decreased bladder capacity and increased urinary frequency. But I'm not sure.\\n\\nIn the context of cystometry, that's the gold standard for assessing bladder function. It looks at how the detrusor contracts and relaxes, and measures residual volume. If her detrusor contractions are normal, then maybe the problem is elsewhere, like the sphincter. But if the Q-tip test shows normal function, then maybe the issue is with the detrusor.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about what cystometry would most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions. So, if the Q-tip test shows normal sphincter function, then the issue isn't sphincter-related. So, the problem must be with the detrusor.\\n\\nBut how does that relate to residual volume? Residual volume is the remaining urine after voiding. If the detrusor isn't contracting well, maybe the bladder doesn't empty completely, leading to residual volume. But she's having leakage, so maybe her bladder is emptying, but not fully, causing some residual volume. Or maybe her detrusor is overactive, leading to more contractions, but not enough to empty the bladder, causing urgency.\\n\\nWait, but if the detrusor is overactive, she'd have more frequent contractions, leading to urgency, but if the sphincter is working, she might leak when she can't hold it. So, in the context of cystometry, if the detrusor is overactive, it would show increased contractions, leading to higher detrusor pressure. But the residual volume would depend on how much is left after voiding.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the detrusor is not contracting well, the residual volume would be higher. But I'm not sure.\\n\\nI think I need to consider that the Q-tip test showing normal function suggests the sphincter is okay. So, the issue is with the detrusor. If the detrusor is overactive, leading to more contractions and urgency, then during cystometry, we'd see increased detrusor contractions. But what about residual volume? If the detrusor is overactive, maybe the bladder empties more completely, so residual volume is normal. Or maybe it's the opposite.\\n\\nWait, maybe the detrusor being overactive leads to more frequent, stronger contractions, but if the sphincter is working, the leakage is minimal. But in this case, the patient has significant leakage during activities, so maybe the detrusor is not contracting well enough, leading to incomplete emptying, causing the bladder to hold more urine, leading to overflow and leakage.\\n\\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. The key points are:\\n\\n- Involuntary leakage during coughing/sneezing, no night leakage: likely stress incontinence, but maybe due to detrusor overactivity.\\n- Q-tip test shows normal function: urethral sphincter is working well.\\n- So, the issue is not with the sphincter, but with the detrusor.\\n\\nIf the detrusor is overactive, it would cause increased contractions, leading to more frequent urination and urgency. But in the context of cystometry, which measures how the bladder responds, we'd see increased contractions. However, if the sphincter is working, the leakage would be minimal. But in this case, the leakage is happening, so maybe the detrusor is not contracting well, leading to incomplete emptying, and the bladder holds more, leading to overflow and leakage.\\n\\nWait, but if the detrusor is overactive, the bladder would empty more, so residual volume might be normal. But if the detrusor is not contracting well, the bladder can't empty, leading to residual volume.\\n\\nI think the answer is that cystometry would show increased detrusor contractions and normal residual\"]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(response[0].split(\"### Answer:\")[1])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.141708Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.141955Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.145934Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.141939Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.145243Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what cystometry would show for this 61-year-old woman.

So maybe her bladder capacity is normal, and she doesn't have nocturnal polyuria. The detrusor contractions might be normal, but the issue is that she can't hold the urine during the day because of stress or something else.\n\nWait, but she's 61, and maybe she's experiencing some age-related changes. The detrusor might become less responsive over time, leading to decreased bladder capacity and increased urinary frequency. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn the context of cystometry, that's the gold standard for assessing bladder function. It looks at how the detrusor contracts and relaxes, and measures residual volume. If her detrusor contractions are normal, then maybe the problem is elsewhere, like the sphincter. But if the Q-tip test shows normal function, then maybe the issue is with the detrusor.\n\nWait, but the question is about what cystometry would most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions. So, if the Q-tip test shows normal sphincter function, then the issue isn't sphincter-related. So, the problem must be with the detrusor.\n\nBut how does that relate to residual volume? Residual volume is the remaining urine after voiding. If the detrusor isn't contracting well, maybe the bladder doesn't empty completely, leading to residual volume. But she's having leakage, so maybe her bladder is emptying, but not fully, causing some residual volume. Or maybe her detrusor is overactive, leading to more contractions, but not enough to empty the bladder, causing urgency.\n\nWait, but if the detrusor is overactive, she'd have more frequent contractions, leading to urgency, but if the sphincter is working, she might leak when she can't hold it. So, in the context of cystometry, if the detrusor is overactive, it would show increased contractions, leading to higher detrusor pressure. But the residual volume would depend on how much is left after voiding.\n\nAlternatively, if the detrusor is not contracting well, the residual volume would be higher. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think I need to consider that the Q-tip test showing normal function suggests the sphincter is okay. So, the issue is with the detrusor. If the detrusor is overactive, leading to more contractions and urgency, then during cystometry, we'd see increased detrusor contractions. But what about residual volume? If the detrusor is overactive, maybe the bladder empties more completely, so residual volume is normal. Or maybe it's the opposite.\n\nWait, maybe the detrusor being overactive leads to more frequent, stronger contractions, but if the sphincter is working, the leakage is minimal. But in this case, the patient has significant leakage during activities, so maybe the detrusor is not contracting well enough, leading to incomplete emptying, causing the bladder to hold more urine, leading to overflow and leakage.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. The key points are:\n\n- Involuntary leakage during coughing/sneezing, no night leakage: likely stress incontinence, but maybe due to detrusor overactivity.\n- Q-tip test shows normal function: urethral sphincter is working well.\n- So, the issue is not with the sphincter, but with the detrusor.\n\nIf the detrusor is overactive, it would cause increased contractions, leading to more frequent urination and urgency. But in the context of cystometry, which measures how the bladder responds, we'd see increased contractions. However, if the sphincter is working, the leakage would be minimal. But in this case, the leakage is happening, so maybe the detrusor is not contracting well, leading to incomplete emptying, and the bladder holds more, leading to overflow and leakage.\n\nWait, but if the detrusor is overactive, the bladder would empty more, so residual volume might be normal. But if the detrusor is not contracting well, the bladder can't empty, leading to residual volume.\n\nI think the answer is that cystometry would show increased detrusor contractions and normal residual\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Setup fine-tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load Dataset\nmedical_dataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\", \"en\", split = \"train[:500]\", trust_remote_code = True)\n\nmedical_dataset[1]\n\nEOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Define EOS_TOKEN which tells the model when to stop generating text during training\nEOS_TOKEN","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.146663Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.146830Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.362520Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T12:33:27.146817Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.361785Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.97k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"953dcb7845534843981bbbb3b41efe06"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/58.2M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6e67c4cdf71b4ef48f64f63d9883bcdf"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/19704 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8d5d999f52494c4eac18fad30537c712"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":18,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### Finetuning\n# Updated training prompt style to add </think> tag\ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\nPlease answer the following medical question.\n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.364329Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.364515Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.368058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.364501Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.367456Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Prepare the data for fine-tuning\n\ndef preprocess_input_data(examples):\n  inputs = examples[\"Question\"]\n  cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]\n  outputs = examples[\"Response\"]\n\n  texts = []\n\n  for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):\n    text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n    texts.append(text)\n\n  return {\n      \"texts\" : texts,\n  }\n\nfinetune_dataset = medical_dataset.map(preprocess_input_data, batched = True)\n\nfinetune_dataset[\"texts\"][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.368777Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.369141Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.494062Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.369116Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T12:33:30.493518Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6015c57aed1d431097a2e7eb2c85bf32"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":20,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.\\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\\nPlease answer the following medical question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nGiven the symptoms of sudden weakness in the left arm and leg, recent long-distance travel, and the presence of swollen and tender right lower leg, what specific cardiac abnormality is most likely to be found upon further evaluation that could explain these findings?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg.
