Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence. I remember that stress incontinence is often due to the urethral sphincter not closing properly during activities that increase abdominal pressure, like coughing.\\n\\nShe doesn't leak at night, which is interesting because that's more common in cases of urge incontinence or overactive bladder. So, her issue is likely not related to nighttime bladder activity but rather daytime stress.\\n\\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I think the Q-tip test is used to check for urethral obstruction. If the Q-tip is positive, it means there's a urethral obstruction, which can cause symptoms like difficulty starting urination or weak stream. But if it's negative, then maybe the issue isn't with the urethral structure but something else, like the sphincter.\\n\\nNow, considering cystometry, which is also called a bladder diary or filling test. It measures how much the bladder can hold and how it responds to filling. The test is usually done by filling the bladder with a small catheter and measuring the volume at which the patient feels the urge to urinate.\\n\\nIn a normal individual, the bladder can hold about 500-600 mL comfortably. When it's full, the detrusor muscle contracts to push the urine out. If there's an issue, like a weak detrusor contraction, the muscle might not empty the bladder completely, leading to residual volume.\\n\\nGiven that the patient has stress incontinence, I'm thinking that her bladder capacity might be normal, but her detrusor contractions might be weak. This would mean that even though her bladder is full, the muscle doesn't contract strongly enough to push the urine out, leading to involuntary loss during activities like coughing.\\n\\nAdditionally, the residual volume after voiding might be higher than normal because the detrusor doesn't empty completely. This residual volume could contribute to the sensation of not emptying the bladder completely, which might be a source of her symptoms.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the cystometry would likely show that her bladder can hold a normal amount, but the detrusor contractions are weak, resulting in incomplete emptying and residual volume. This aligns with stress urinary incontinence rather than urge incontinence.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe cystometry results for this 61-year-old woman with a history of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal that her bladder can hold a normal volume, but her detrusor contractions are weak. This indicates that the detrusor muscle does not contract sufficiently to empty the bladder completely, leading to incomplete voiding and residual volume.
