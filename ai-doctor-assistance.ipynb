Let's break it down.\\n\\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence. But she doesn't leak at night, which is interesting because usually, with UI, you might leak both day and night. Maybe she's using some strategies to prevent nighttime leakage, like going to the bathroom more often or using a catheter.\\n\\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I remember that the Q-tip test is used to check for urethral obstruction. The provider inserts a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and measures pressure. If the pressure is higher than normal, it suggests obstruction, which could lead to retention or difficulty emptying the bladder.\\n\\nSo, during the Q-tip test, if there's a high resistance or pressure reading, that would point towards urethral obstruction. This could be due to something like a urethral stricture, a tumor, or maybe an infection. If that's the case, the cystometry would show that her bladder can't empty completely because there's resistance at the urethral outlet.\\n\\nCystometry, also known as a voiding cystogram, is used to assess how the bladder empties. It involves filling the bladder and then taking X-rays to see if there's any contrast material left in the bladder after urination. If there's retained contrast, it indicates residual volume.\\n\\nIn this patient's case, the fact that she doesn't leak at night might mean her bladder is emptying adequately during the day, but maybe there's some residual volume that doesn't cause leakage. However, if the Q-tip test shows obstruction, the cystometry would likely reveal that her bladder isn't emptying as effectively, leading to some residual volume. Additionally, detrusor contractions refer to the muscle contractions of the bladder that help empty it. If there's obstruction, the contractions might be stronger or more frequent to try to push the urine out, but if that's not possible due to obstruction, the contractions might not be as effective.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the cystometry would probably show some residual volume in the bladder because of the obstruction, and the detrusor contractions might be increased in frequency or strength, but if there's obstruction, they might not lead to complete emptying.\\n\\nI think I've covered the main points. The key here is the Q-tip test indicating obstruction, which would influence both the residual volume and the detrusor contractions during cystometry.\\n</think>\\n\\nCystometry for this 61-year-old woman would likely reveal evidence of residual volume in her bladder due to urethral obstruction, as indicated by the Q-tip test. The detrusor contractions may appear increased in frequency or strength, but the obstruction would hinder complete emptying, suggesting that her body is compensating by contracting more frequently or with greater force.

Given her vital signs of pulse 110/min, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 90/65 mm Hg, along with the presence of a 5-cm deep stab wound at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line, which anatomical structure in her chest is most likely to be injured?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Okay, let's figure out what's going on here. A woman comes in with a stab wound from a screwdriver. It's in her chest, upper border of the 8th rib, left side, kind of around the midaxillary line. First thought, that's pretty close to where the lung sits, right?\\n\\nLet's talk about location first. This spot is along the left side of her body. Above the 8th rib, like that, is where a lot of important stuff lives, like the bottom part of the left lung, possibly the diaphragm too, especially considering how deep the screwdriver went.\\n\\nThe wound is 5 cm deep. That sounds pretty deep. I mean, it could definitely reach down to the lung tissue or maybe the diaphragm. Given that it's midaxillary, we're in the territory where the lower lobe of the left lung hangs out. It's also possible there's some intersection with where the diaphragm begins, but the lung feels more probable somehow.\\n\\nNow, her vitals are concerning: elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. This is serious. My gut says that this kind of vital sign picture could mean something like pneumothorax or maybe hemothorax. Both can happen if the lung gets punctured, and they can make the blood pressure drop and the heart rate skyrocket since she's obviously distressed.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the most obvious culprit is the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound's depth and her condition point that way. And, yeah, this adds up with pneumothorax or maybe blood collecting in the chest—the kind of stuff that can really mess with breathing and circulation.\\n\\nAlright, with this in mind, it sure seems like the lung is the most likely thing that got hurt here. Makes sense given the situation, where the wound is, considering her symptoms, and the whole setup.\",\n 'Response': 'In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured is the lower lobe of the left lung. The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung.

We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step9: Setup/Apply LoRA finetuning to the model\n\nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model = model,\n    r = 16,\n    target_modules = [\n        \"q_proj\",\n        \"k_proj\",\n        \"v_proj\",\n        \"o_proj\",\n        \"gate_proj\",\n        \"up_proj\",\n        \"down_proj\"\n    ],\n    lora_alpha = 16,\n    lora_dropout = 0,\n    bias = \"none\",\n    use_gradient_checkpointing = \"unsloth\",\n    random_state = 3047,\n    use_rslora = False,\n    loftq_config = None\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:20:18.997619Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:20:18.997899Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:20:25.621323Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:20:18.997882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:20:25.620778Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.6.1 patched 32 layers with 32 QKV layers, 32 O layers and 32 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add this before creating the trainer\nif hasattr(model, '_unwrapped_old_generate'):\n    del model._unwrapped_old_generate","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:33:59.208518Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:33:59.209027Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:33:59.212387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:33:59.209004Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:33:59.211807Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def formatting_func(example):\n    question = example.get(\"Question\", \"\")\n    cot = example.get(\"Complex_CoT\", \"\")\n    response = example.get(\"Response\", \"\")\n    texts = example.get(\"texts\", \"\")\n    try:\n        prompt = train_prompt_style.format(question, cot, response, texts) + EOS_TOKEN\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Prompt formatting failed:\", e)\n        prompt = f\"Q: {question}\\nCOT: {cot}\\nA: {response}\\nT:{texts}{EOS_TOKEN}\"\n    return {\"text\": prompt}","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:34:00.834874Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:34:00.835140Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:34:00.839957Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:34:00.835120Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:34:00.839327Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"finetune_dataset = finetune_dataset.map(formatting_func)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:34:02.407655Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:34:02.407902Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:34:02.487024Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:34:02.407885Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:34:02.486204Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ?

Based on these findings,\\n              what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Answer:\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what the cystometry would show for this 61-year-old woman. She's been having involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes, but she doesn't leak at night. She had a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I need to connect these findings to what the cystometry might reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that cystometry is a test used to measure how the bladder responds to filling and emptying. It can show things like how much the bladder can hold (residual volume) and how well it contracts (detrusor contractions) during filling.\\n\\nThe patient's history is key here. Involuntary urine loss during coughing or sneezing suggests that her bladder isn't emptying completely after these activities. So, maybe her detrusor muscles aren't contracting properly to push out all the urine. This could be due to either a functional issue, like a weak contraction, or a structural issue, like a urethral obstruction or something else affecting the outlet.\\n\\nThe Q-tip test was done during the gynecological exam. I think the Q-tip is inserted into the vagina and then connected to a pressure transducer to measure bladder pressure. If the pressure reading is high, it might indicate that the bladder is overfilled, leading to involuntary contractions or leakage. Alternatively, low pressure could mean the bladder isn't filling properly.\\n\\nSince she doesn't leak at night, it's less likely to be a problem with nighttime detrusor activity, but more about daytime function. So, the issue is probably related to the bladder not emptying when it's supposed to, like during a cough.\\n\\nIn cystometry, when they fill the bladder and measure the pressure, if the detrusor isn't contracting well, the pressure might not increase as expected when the bladder is filled. This could mean that the detrusor muscles aren't responding properly, leading to incomplete emptying.\\n\\nAlso, the residual volume after the test could be higher than normal. If the detrusor doesn't contract well, more urine remains in the bladder after the test, which might explain the involuntary losses.\\n\\nI should also consider other possibilities. For example, if there's urethral obstruction, the Q-tip test might show elevated pressures, and the cystometry might show a normal capacity but poor emptying. Or, if there's a neurologic issue affecting bladder control, the detrusor contractions might be weak or absent, leading to retention and leakage.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the cystometry is likely to show that the detrusor contractions are inadequate during filling, resulting in a higher residual volume. This would explain why she's experiencing urine loss during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, like coughing or sneezing.\\n</think>\\n\\nBased on the patient's history and the Q-tip test findings, the cystometry is expected to reveal inadequate detrusor contractions and a higher residual volume. Here's the breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Detrusor Contractions**: The test will likely show that the detrusor muscles are not contracting properly. This inadequate contraction may lead to incomplete emptying of the bladder, contributing to the involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing.\\n\\n2. **Residual Volume**: The residual volume after filling will be higher than normal. This is because the bladder is not emptying completely, resulting in more urine remaining in the bladder.\\n\\n3. **Functional vs. Structural Causes**: The findings suggest a functional issue, possibly related to weak detrusor muscle contractions.

I remember that 6.5% NaCl is a medium that's used to identify whether bacteria are highly resistant to sodium chloride, which is a feature of some pathogenic bacteria like Streptococcus agalactiae (which is also called group B streptococcus). So if they don't grow in that medium, that might suggest they're not highly salt-resistant, which could mean they're not the typical aggressive pathogen like S. agalactiae.\n\nWait, but the blood cultures did grow, right? So the fact that they don't grow in 6.5% NaCl might indicate that they're not as salt-resistant as some other gram-positive cocci. So maybe they're not the typical cause of endocarditis, which is usually seen with S. viridans or S. agalactiae, which are known to cause subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in cases where there's a predisposing factor like aortic stenosis or previous heart surgery.\n\nBut in this case, the vegetation is on the aortic valve, and the patient has a fever and other signs of infection. So endocarditis is likely. Now, what predisposes endocarditis? Common predisposing factors include aortic stenosis, previous heart valve surgery, intravenous drug use, and certain medical conditions like HIV or diabetes. However, this patient doesn't mention any history of IV drug use or HIV, and he's 59, which is a bit older, so maybe not HIV.\n\nAnother thought: the blood culture result might help determine the specific organism. Since they're gram-positive, catalase-negative, and in chains, that's more consistent with Streptococcus or Enterococcus. But Enterococcus is usually catalase-positive, so this is more likely Streptococcus. Now, S. agalactiae is the one that causes endocarditis, especially in cases of aortic stenosis. But wait, the fact that they don't grow in 6.5% NaCl might mean they're not S. agalactiae, because S. agalactiae is highly salt-resistant.\n\nWait, so if the organism doesn't grow in 6.5% NaCl, maybe it's not S. agalactiae. So maybe it's a different organism, like S. viridans, which is also a gram-positive cocci but not as salt-resistant. S. viridans is known to cause subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the context of aortic stenosis or other valvular abnormalities.\n\nSo putting this together, the most likely scenario is that the patient has subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by S. viridans. The predisposing factor here is probably the aortic valve vegetation itself, but more specifically, the underlying condition that predisposed the valve to infection. The presence of the vegetation on the aortic valve is a result of the endocarditis, but the predisposing factor could be something else, like aortic stenosis.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the most likely predisposing factor for the patient's condition. The patient's condition includes the fever, chills, etc., which are due to the endocarditis. So the predisposing factors for endocarditis would be things like aortic stenosis, previous valve surgery, or other conditions that make the immune system compromise.\n\nBut without more info, the most likely answer would be that the presence of the vegetation on the aortic valve is due to the endocarditis, and the predisposing factor is probably aortic stenosis or another valvular abnormality. However, the question is about the most likely predisposing factor, so maybe it's the presence of the vegetation itself, but more accurately, it's the underlying condition that allows the bacteria to grow there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the predisposing factor is the presence of the vegetation, but that's not quite right. The vegetation is a consequence, not a cause.\n\nWait, another angle: the fact that the blood cultures show gram-positive, catalase-negative, gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains that don't grow in 6.5% NaCl suggests that the organism is not highly salt-resistant. This is typical of S. viridans, which is known to cause subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the context of aortic stenosis or other valvular conditions. So the predisposing factor here is likely aortic stenosis, which is a condition that allows the bacteria to settle on the valve and cause infection.\n\nSo, to sum up, the most likely predisposing factor is aortic stenosis, as it creates the environment for the bacterial growth on the valve, leading to the endocarditis and the associated symptoms.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is **aortic stenosis**. This is because the presence of a vegetation on the aortic valve, along with the blood culture results indicating gram-positive, catalase-negative, gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains that do not grow in a 6.5% NaCl medium, suggests subacute bacterial end\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question = \"\"\" A 65-year-old man presents with chest pain radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath. \nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\"\"\"\n\nFastLanguageModel.for_inference(model_lora)\n\n# Tokenize the input\ninputs = tokenizer([prompt_style.format(question, \"\")], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n# Generate a response\noutputs = model_lora.generate (\n    input_ids = inputs.input_ids,\n    attention_mask = inputs.attention_mask,\n    max_new_tokens = 1200,\n    use_cache = True\n)\n\n# Decode the response tokens back to text\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)\n\nprint(response[0].split(\"### Answer:\")[1])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:49:16.187264Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:49:16.187656Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:49:57.912961Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:49:16.187636Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:49:57.912156Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this medical question. A 65-year-old man comes in with chest pain that's radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath. Hmm, what's the most likely diagnosis here?\n\nOkay, so first, I need to think about the symptoms. Chest pain is a common complaint, but when it's accompanied by arm pain and shortness of breath, that's a red flag. I remember that the left arm is a key symptom in relation to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which is a major coronary artery.\n\nSo, possible conditions could be a myocardial infarction, or more specifically, a STEMI. STEMI stands for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The classic presentation includes chest pain, arm pain, and shortness of breath, which fits this patient's symptoms.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider other possibilities to rule out. Maybe it's just angina, but the shortness of breath makes it more likely to be a STEMI. Also, could it be a pulmonary issue like a pulmonary embolism? That can cause chest pain too, but the radiation to the arm is more characteristic of a coronary issue.\n\nI should also think about the patient's age. At 65, he's in a higher risk category for cardiovascular disease, which supports the idea of a STEMI. Additionally, the ECG would be crucial here. If an ECG shows ST elevation in the left arm leads, that confirms a STEMI.\n\nAnother thought: could it be a muscle strain? But the radiation to the arm and the shortness of breath are more indicative of a cardiac cause. Plus, a muscle strain usually doesn't cause shortness of breath to that extent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is a STEMI, specifically involving the LAD. This would require immediate treatment, probably with thrombolysis or primary angioplasty if possible, to restore blood flow and prevent further damage to the heart muscle.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely diagnosis for a 65-year-old man presenting with chest pain radiating to his left arm and shortness of breath is a **ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**, specifically involving the left anterior descending artery (LAD). \n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **Symptoms**: The combination of chest pain, left arm pain, and shortness of breath is highly suggestive of a STEMI.\n2. **Patient Age**: At 65, the patient is at higher risk for coronary artery disease, supporting the diagnosis of a STEMI.\n3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: ST-segment elevation in the left arm leads would confirm the diagnosis of a STEMI.\n4. **Immediate Treatment**: The patient would require urgent treatment, such as thrombolysis or primary angioplasty, to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery and prevent myocardial damage.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the classic presentation of STEMI symptoms and the patient's age, making it the most likely diagnosis.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question = \"\"\"A 45-year-old woman presents with weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance. \nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\"\"\"\n\nFastLanguageModel.for_inference(model_lora)\n\n# Tokenize the input\ninputs = tokenizer([prompt_style.format(question, \"\")], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n# Generate a response\noutputs = model_lora.generate (\n    input_ids = inputs.input_ids,\n    attention_mask = inputs.attention_mask,\n    max_new_tokens = 1200,\n    use_cache = True\n)\n\n# Decode the response tokens back to text\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)\n\nprint(response[0].split(\"### Answer:\")[1])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-06T17:51:59.085128Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-06T17:51:59.085755Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-06T17:52:51.503064Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-06T17:51:59.085731Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-06T17:52:51.502267Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the most likely diagnosis for a 45-year-old woman who's presenting with weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that weight gain can be caused by a variety of factors. It could be due to hormonal changes, medications, lack of sleep, or underlying health conditions. Fatigue is another symptom that can be related to many issues, from lack of sleep to more serious conditions like hypothyroidism or anemia.\n\nCold intolerance, or difficulty tolerating cold temperatures, is interesting. That makes me think about thyroid function because hypothyroidism can cause the body to have trouble regulating temperature. When the thyroid is underactive, the metabolism slows down, making it harder to generate heat, hence the cold intolerance.\n\nWeight gain, even when eating the same diet, could also be a sign of hypothyroidism. The metabolism is slow, so the body doesn't burn calories as efficiently, leading to weight gain. Fatigue would make sense too because the body isn't getting the energy it needs.\n\nI should also consider other possibilities. Could it be something like Cushing's syndrome or hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction? Those can cause similar symptoms, but they are less common. Cushing's typically presents with more pronounced symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and skin changes.\n\nAnother thought: could it be related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS can cause weight gain, fatigue, and sometimes cold intolerance. However, PCOS is more common in women of reproductive age, though it can affect others as well. The symptoms might overlap with hypothyroidism, so it's possible, but I think hypothyroidism is a more likely culprit here.\n\nI should also think about the lab tests that would be useful. A TSH test is crucial for checking thyroid function. Low TSH would suggest hypothyroidism. If the TSH is normal, then maybe an anti-thyroid antibodies test or checking for other causes of hypothyroidism like Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\nIt's also important to rule out other conditions. For example, if the patient has a history of depression, that could contribute to fatigue and weight gain, but the cold intolerance would still point towards a physiological issue rather than a psychological one.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis here is hypothyroidism, given the combination of weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance. It's a common condition that can present with these symptoms, and it's easily diagnosed with appropriate testing.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old woman presenting with weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance is **hypothyroidism**. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Symptoms:**\n   - **Weight Gain:** Can be indicative of a slow metabolism, as seen in hypothyroidism.\n   - **Fatigue:** Common in hypothyroidism due to reduced energy production.\n   - **Cold Intolerance:** Related to poor thermoregulation, a symptom of hypothyroidism.\n\n2. **Consider Other Possibilities:**\n   - While conditions like PCOS or Cushing's syndrome could present similarly, hypothyroidism is more likely due to its prevalence and matching symptoms.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Testing:**\n   - **TSH Test:** Essential to check for low TSH levels, indicative of hypothyroidism.\n   - **Anti-Thyroid Antibodies:** To determine if Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the cause.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Hypothyroidism is the primary diagnosis given the symptom profile and its typical presentation in women of this age group.\n\n**Final Answer:** The most likely diagnosis is **hypothyroidism**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":40},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
